Detecting high curvature points on the boundary:

Working program: hcBoundHaimeri3
	- uses TNT and JAMAC++ for the eigenvalue calculation


NOTWORKING/hcBoundHaimeri2 : own version for eigenvalue and eigenvector calculation
	- not working - needs more work.


BoundPoints.h .cpp 
	- determines the boundary points from a dataset and fills in a boundary structure
		containing the neighbourhood information and normals
